Hi, this site is a profile of a research student at Imperial College. In summary, the master of this site grew up in a small town by the sea in southwestern China. He claims that he learned talking before walking. At the age of 2, he started playing PAL98 on a WINDOWS98 OS, the first ever game in his life. Later, Age of Empires II and C&C Red Alert 2 became his second and third. He continued to be a gamer until later years in primary school, when he was no longer satisfied by playing, but rather to create his own game. The first attempt was made using the campaign editor on Age of Empires II, which is also the first coding(-ish) he had done. He learned the skills on a BBS forum hawkaoc.net. At the age of 12, he started playing DOTA, a custom map on WAR3, Up until 2021 he wasted 5000 hours in his life on the successor game DOTA2, unsurprisingly.

It could be his research, book review or anything else in his life that he will post on this site.

Hi this is R3DR4NP4. I set up this page when doing my PhD at Imperial College.

My research interest concerns swimming mechanisms in Stokes flow and numerical methods.

Ciliates are micro-organisms characterized by the presence of numerous slender organelles called cilia emerging form the cell body, and propel themselves through periodic beatings of cilia. In the former studies, the induced ciliary propulsion was analysed by introducing an 'envelope' near the surface of the cell body, but the individuality of cilia is ignored (Squirmers). My research will look into the swimming mechanisms of ciliates from the first principle, how they interact with each other and the resulting collective motions.

Below are pictures from my MSc thesis and hopefully they give you an intuition of what I am studying. -->
