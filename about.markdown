This site is the profile of a science research student at Imperial College. It could be his book reviews, research or whatever he finds fun that he will post here. This site also serves as a sanctuary which protects the master from all the dazzling social apps while still preserves his existence in the cyberspace.

In summary, the master of this site grew up in a small town onshore in southwestern China. He claims that he learned talking before walking. At the age of two, he started his career as a gamer with his first ever PC game PAL98 played on a WINDOWS98 OS. Closing to the end of primary school, he was no longer satisifed being just a gamer, and instead he was eager to create his own. He then taught himself computing. After Internet emerged, he began participating on BBS forums, where he published several custom campaigns on Age of Empires II. As he became an experienced PC user, he started to feel bothered by his incompetence of explaining how those mysterious electronic components produce animated Genghis Khan and his troop on the screen. The curiosity lured him into the scientific world eventually. By the end of middle school he was fascinated by how the science he learned helped him with his developments of 'carbon dioxide bottle cap lanucher', 'pesticide sprayer flamethrower' and so on... After completing middle school, he met his first girl on the summer camp train to Beijing. He captured her heart by demonstrating the binary and decimal conversion of a number, and how to solve the Hanoi tower problem by recursion. In high school, he was the best in scientific subjects, but also very terrible in Chinese. The latter became one but not the only reason why he moved to the UK and changed the trajectory of his life completely.

Hi this is R3DR4NP4. I set up this page when doing my PhD at Imperial College.

My research interest concerns swimming mechanisms in Stokes flow and numerical methods.

Ciliates are micro-organisms characterized by the presence of numerous slender organelles called cilia emerging form the cell body, and propel themselves through periodic beatings of cilia. In the former studies, the induced ciliary propulsion was analysed by introducing an 'envelope' near the surface of the cell body, but the individuality of cilia is ignored (Squirmers). My research will look into the swimming mechanisms of ciliates from the first principle, how they interact with each other and the resulting collective motions.

Below are pictures from my MSc thesis and hopefully they give you an intuition of what I am studying. -->
