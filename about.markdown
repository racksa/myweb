This site is a profile of a research student at Imperial College. In summary, the master of this site grew up in a small town onshore in southwestern China. He claims that he learned talking before walking. At the age of two, he started playing PAL98 on a WINDOWS98 OS, the first ever game in his life. In primary school finishing years, he was no longer satisifed being just a gamer, and instead he was eager to create his own game. He then taught himself programming. After Internet emerged, he began participating on BBS forums, where he published several Age of Empires II custom campaigns. As he progressed as a computer user, he became bothered by his incompetence of explaining how those mysterious electronic components produce animated Genghis Khan and his troop on the screen. He could not resist the desire of knowledge, and the curiosity lured him into the scientific world eventually. By the end of middle school he was fascinated by how the science he learned helped him with his developments of 'carbon dioxide bottle cap lanucher', 'pesticide sprayer flamethrower', and so on... After completing middle school, he met his first girl on the summer camp train to Beijing. He captured her heart by demonstrating the binary and decimal conversion of a number, and solving Hanoi tower problem by recursion. In high school, he continued to persue a science career, and was the best in scientific subjects, but also the worst in Chinese. The later became one of the reasons why he moved to the UK and changed the trajectory of his life completely.

It could be book reviews, his research or anything else in his life that he will post on this site.

Hi this is R3DR4NP4. I set up this page when doing my PhD at Imperial College.

My research interest concerns swimming mechanisms in Stokes flow and numerical methods.

Ciliates are micro-organisms characterized by the presence of numerous slender organelles called cilia emerging form the cell body, and propel themselves through periodic beatings of cilia. In the former studies, the induced ciliary propulsion was analysed by introducing an 'envelope' near the surface of the cell body, but the individuality of cilia is ignored (Squirmers). My research will look into the swimming mechanisms of ciliates from the first principle, how they interact with each other and the resulting collective motions.

Below are pictures from my MSc thesis and hopefully they give you an intuition of what I am studying. -->
