It was a Friday in December, after all the meetings, seminar and teachings I sat in the office and felt too tired to do any work. It was that moment I decided to grab the book 'What do you care what other people think', the autobiography of Richard Feynman, sitting on my shelf for a while now, and browse through it. 

I only managed to finish the first 30 pages, which is about a quarter of the first chapter. Feynman stated in this first section of the book mostly how he spend pretty much his whole childhood and teenage disagreeing with people.
