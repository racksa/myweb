                <h4>My research interest concerns swimming mechanisms in Stokes flow and numerical methods.</h4>

				<h4>Ciliates are micro-organisms characterized by the presence of numerous slender organelles called cilia emerging form the cell body, and propel themselves through periodic beatings of cilia. In the former studies, the induced ciliary propulsion was analysed by introducing an 'envelope' near the surface of the cell body, but the individuality of cilia is ignored (Squirmers). My research will look into the swimming mechanisms of ciliates from the first principle, how they interact with each other and the resulting collective motions.

				Below are pictures from my MSc thesis and hopefully they give you an intuition of what I am studying.</h4>
