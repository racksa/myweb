My own written Linear Algebra notes, which should be comprehensive even for pre-uni students - if not, it was all my fault and I should have done it better. Through these notes, I aim to tell you why linear algebra is important, and how to apply linear algebra to do fun staff. Every note starts with a meaningful question, and I will set up the mathematical model step by step. At the end, I will show you how a real problem collapses into a linear algebra problem!

<!-- These notes are not textbooks, and most of them do not teach you how to solve a matrix problem! Instead, they show you the scenarios when linear algebra is involved. -->

I hope you find them fun, and I will be grateful if you can give me any suggestions. Enjoy!
